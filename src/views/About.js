            SanPlan saves sanitation practitioners the time and challenges of
            collecting, analyzing, and mapping data to inform their program
            design by giving them access to key contextual data required for
            planning sanitation programs all in one place. SanPlan brings
            together data on settlement-level accessibility, environmental,
            demographic, socioeconomic, and WASH factors and displays the
            information spatially within a map. Users can explore trends and
            patterns within a geographic area, or use the built in filters and
            sliders to customize their analysis and download detailed, granular
            data on their area of interest.

              <strong>Who</strong> should use this tool?
            </Typography>
            <br></br>
            The tool is designed for anyone in the planning or budgeting phase
            of a sanitation project at the national, regional or local scale.
            Typical users might include government agencies, program funders,
            and implementing partners who are looking to understand more
            existing context where they are planning to work. Users might use
            SanPlan to identify where communities with high open defecation
            rates and low access to sanitation are in a specific region, or they
            may be interested to know how many settlement areas/communities in
            their region are on a major roadway.

            <br></br>
            SanPlan uses existing publicly available data and links it to a
            specific location on the map. This allows users to click anywhere on
            the map and access information on key contextual factors. Because
            GPS locations for communities are often unknown or difficult to
            obtain, SanPlan has developed its own method for identifying
            communities and settlements of all sizes on the map. (You can learn
            more about this below). In the future, users will be able to upload
            their own community locations and data and have them visualized in
            the map.
